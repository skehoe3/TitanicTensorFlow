# Read Me

This repository is my first foray into machine learning with TensorFlow.  I used TensorFlow, Keras, Pandas, and Scikit-learn to predict whether or not a passenger survived the titanic disaster.  

# To Do List
- Do some feature engineering
- Experiment with penalties for false positives/negatives
- Use a different model
